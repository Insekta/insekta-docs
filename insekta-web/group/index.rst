Insekta-Web Group Management
===================================

Creating Groups
-------------------------

Now you can login with the admin account and go to the administration page. Here you can set up many things, 
for example groups. You can create a group for persons which are able to create and update scenarios. For 
this purpose, you can filter the rights with 'scen' and then you can select all and add them to the group.
Finally, you have to save your group configuration.

Afterwards, you can go to the user administration. There you can choose a user and add him to a group, but
you have also to select the checkbox for 'Staff Status'. Otherwise the user will not be able to open the admin page.

For example, you can create a group for people which are able to manage scenarios and courses.
