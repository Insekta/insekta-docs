This installation guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to setup Insekta from scratch.

Requirements
------------
-  A physical machine (called ``insekta host``) on which Insekta will be installed. Initial physical access is required for setting up the operating system. A brief guide on setting up SSH access is given below such that physical access is no longer necessary.
-  Another physical machine, e.g., your laptop, that is used to setup and configure Insekta from remote. Such a device is not necessary if you instead decide to use the ``insekta host`` directly.
-  A working internet connection.
-  A USB flash drive with at least 1 GB.
-  Roughly 60 minutes of free time.
